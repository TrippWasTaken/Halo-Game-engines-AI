# Instructions
To launch the assignment simply load the project into godot and click play, the main scene is scene1 and it'll play through all of them in order, when the end screen appears the window will close itself after 10 seconds.

# How it works
I have used primarily colliders and path following in this assignment, most of my detection is done through "Field of view" collision, an area is attached to the an object and if something enters the object it'll trigger some sort of event until its out of the area, be it flying, dodging or shooting. This project could have been written in a lot less scripts as many share the same code slightly modified but I didnt really plan things out as well as I could, however it came out pretty good and I didnt use any tutorials for once

# Features
- Ship AI that fires at pelican
- Ship AI to dodge incoming fire
- Ship AI to look for enemies and fire at them until none are left
- Top quality "voice acting" :D
- path following ships

# Storyboard
 - The initial scene starts off with a pelican flying towards a new unkown halo ring
 - Soon after the an enemy ship slip spaces right into the stray pelican
 - With no back up the pelican tries to back off as the enemy cruiser begins to fire onto them. The pelican will dodge these shots as they    are relatively slow for the small pelican.
 - The enemies then deploy a fleet of banshees to chase and take down the pelican.
 - The pelican will fight off and destory the banshee fleet but will get shot down trying to find a safe location to land
 - It will crash land on a random location on the newly found ring as they call for help
