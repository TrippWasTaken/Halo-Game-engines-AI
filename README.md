# HaloGE2Assignment
A Halo style space battle simulation

# Storyboard
 - The initial scene starts off with a pelican flying towards a new unkown halo ring
 - Soon after the an enemy ship slip spaces right into the stray pelican
 - With no back up the pelican tries to back off as the enemy cruiser begins to fire onto them. The pelican will dodge these shots as they    are relatively slow for the small pelican.
 - The enemies then deploy a fleet of banshees to chase and take down the pelican.
 - The pelican will fight off and destory the banshee fleet but will get shot down trying to find a safe location to land
 - It will crash land on a random location on the newly found ring as they call for help
