# HaloGE2Assignment

A Halo style space battle simulation
For this assignment I will be using the godot game engine as its one Ive grown to like
The assets and models I will be using are mostly directly rigged from the first halo game, if I can find better or newer models I will be swapping them.
In the final scene I hope to use an entire map file to show the pelican crashing along with a spartan walking out from it but so far I havent been able to get one working properly with textures

# Storyboard
 - The initial scene starts off with a pelican flying towards a new unkown halo ring
 - Soon after the an enemy ship slip spaces right into the stray pelican
 - With no back up the pelican tries to back off as the enemy cruiser begins to fire onto them. The pelican will dodge these shots as they    are relatively slow for the small pelican.
 - The enemies then deploy a fleet of banshees to chase and take down the pelican.
 - The pelican will fight off and destory the banshee fleet but will get shot down trying to find a safe location to land
 - It will crash land on a random location on the newly found ring as they call for help
